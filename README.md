Who said portfolios have to be 2D? 

I’m excited to share my brand new 3D personal portfolio!
As someone who sits at the intersection of AI Research and Web Development, I wanted a space that reflects both my technical depth and creative side.
Built from scratch using React, Three.js and GSAP, 
This site features: An interactive 3D hero scene. Smooth animations and floating elements. A showcase of my research (like my recent work on U-net and Attention U-net for Brain Segmentation) . 
It was a fun and challenge to optimize the 3D models and animations for the web been working with this whole break. 
I have created my whole portfolio of 4 segments all with Three.js a React 3D library which creates the Blender into Website.

SO EVERYTHING IS MOVEABLE
